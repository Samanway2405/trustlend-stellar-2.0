/**
 * ReferralCapture — turns a `?ref=CODE` visit into an attributed referral
 * (Issue #266).
 *
 * Auth here is wallet-based (SIWS), so a user arriving on an invite link does
 * not sign up in one step: they land on /auth, connect a wallet, sign, and only
 * then have a session. The code therefore has to survive that round trip.
 *
 * Flow:
 *   1. Any page load with `?ref=CODE` stores the code in sessionStorage.
 *   2. Once mounted inside the authenticated dashboard, we POST it to
 *      /api/referrals/claim and clear the stored value.
 *
 * sessionStorage (not localStorage) is deliberate: the code should not outlive
 * the browsing session and silently attribute a much later, unrelated signup.
 *
 * Renders nothing. Every failure is silent — a referral that cannot be
 * attributed must never interrupt a user who is trying to use the app.
