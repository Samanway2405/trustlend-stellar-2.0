## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Referral programme (#266): every user gets a unique invite link, and when an
  invited friend's first loan is funded the referrer's bonus is transferred
  automatically by the new `referral_rewards` Soroban contract during
  `activate_loan`. Includes a referral dashboard, attribution APIs, and
  `sql/09_referral_program.sql`. See [REFERRAL_PROGRAM.md](REFERRAL_PROGRAM.md).
- Borrowing user guide and FAQ at `/docs/borrowing`, covering the step-by-step
  borrowing process, how the liquidation threshold is calculated, Health Factor
  bands, and 15 frequently asked questions. Linked from the borrower dashboard
  nav and the landing footer (#265).
- Keyboard-accessible glossary tooltips for financial acronyms (APR, APY, LTV,
  Trust Score, Health Factor, basis points) across the borrower, lender and
  admin dashboards, backed by a shared `lib/glossary` definition list (#264).
- Initial open-source release setup.
- Basic repository files: README, LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, SECURITY.
- GitHub issue and pull request templates.
